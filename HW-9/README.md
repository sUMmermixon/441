About this project: I totally used the lyric idea from another classmate. (thank you)
I dont even care if i get docked points...

*So went to my advisor meeting last friday and found out that I am taking this class completley backwards!

(This class needs to have a strong prerequisit)

-My major is Media Arts. I have not yet taken coding or the class after that. I literally jumped into this one thinking it was the next step after the web design one. WRONG.

+I learned alot! Buuuuuuut in person would be better.
+Better use of GitHub would of helped all of us too.

Farewell Javasript. NEVER AGAIN.
