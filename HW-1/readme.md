I am very frustrated.
Last semester I didnt learn too much from the class. It was very unorganzied and hard to know exactly what was expected.

Coming into this one isnt without challenges. Now it is full throttle and I cant help but feel like i am behind everyone else.

CSS is what is holding me back.
I need more practice or more resources to learn it better for this class.

I do not want to fail :(
