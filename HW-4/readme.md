# HW-4 Readme for SUMMER_MIXON

<ul>
<li>I have no idea what is going on. This is alot of information to not have anyone
explaining it to you (being online and all). I'm pretty disappointed, I feel like
my hopes of being a developer are pretty much deflated. I dont have the days off to
make it in to talk to the instructor. If I'm not doing homework I'm working.
Im gonna fail. :(</li>
